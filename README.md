###About Temboo
Temboo offers free SDKs that give you unified, easy-to-use access to more than 60 public APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Salesforce, Google and more), along with developer-shortcut functions for integrating services. 

You can learn more, and get the Temboo SDK, at  www.temboo.com.

###About the SDK Examples
These examples demonstrate how the Temboo SDK lets you link services together into powerful composite apps. 

Each example is a separate simple executable that integrates data from different sources (all in 250 lines of code or less). Check out:

 * AddTweetsToCalendar -- Twittify your GCal, for a timeline visualization of what you've told the world at Twitter
 * BackupFlickrToDropbox -- Use Dropbox to back up and synchronize your Flickr photosets across devices
 * LastFMToGoogleCalendar -- Never miss a show, by tracking Last.FM event listings on your Google Calendar
 * ListProductOnAmazonMarketplace - Manage items for sale on Amazon, using S3 as a host for your listing images 

###Quickstart
 1. Sign up for a free account at www.temboo.com
 2. Download the SDK and install it in your IDE of choice
 3. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:temboo/SDK-Examples.git`
